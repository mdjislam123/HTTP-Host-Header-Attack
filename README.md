(K)nowledge:

Starting with the knowledge part of the report, I will learn the zero-day vulnerability of the HTTP protocol. However, before beginning writing, we need to know how the HTTP protocol works.

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is an application protocol for transferring data over the web, most commonly used for accessing websites on the internet. HTTP sends requests from a client (such as a web browser) to a server, which then responds with data. The requests and responses are sent in a specific format that follows a set of rules and conventions outlined in the HTTP specification. For example, when a user enters a URL into their web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting that website. The server then responds with the website's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other files, which the browser interprets and displays to the user. But since this protocol was created, many vulnerabilities, exploits, and attacks have existed. As a consequence, users' accounts and personal information were breached.

HTTP vulnerabilities can occur due to flaws in the protocol's design, implementation, or configuration, which attackers can exploit to launch attacks. In the context of HTTP vulnerabilities, exploits are typically used to take advantage of weaknesses in the protocol implementation to achieve a specific goal. For example, an attacker could use an HTTP exploit to host header attack and gain unauthorized access to a web application or server. There are different HTTP exploits, including buffer overflows, authentication bypassing, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, DoS etc. Attacks using HTTP exploits can have a wide range of consequences, depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the attacker's goal. For example, some HTTP exploits attacks can result in data theft, Denial of service (DoS) attacks, or even complete web server control.

To illustrate two HTTP attacks, we can look into the most common vulnerabilities: HTTP header and DDoS attacks.
HTTP Host header attack: When a user requests to change the website password for login, the website makes a unique token and sends a password-changing link along with the token via email or message. When the user visits the link, the website checks whether the token is valid. If the token is valid, the user can change the website password. But in this attack, an attacker targets a vulnerable website and user due to HTTP protocol vulnerability. Then, he sends a request on the login page by putting the targeted user's email address for a password reset. Once the HTTP request has been intercepted, the attacker alters the HTTP host header to point to a domain that is under his control. For example,

"POST /password/reset HTTP 1.1
Host: evil-user.net" (portswigger.net)

The website makes a unique token and sends a password-changing link to the user's email address. On the user side, the user gets a genuine email address from the vulnerable website and clicks the link it provides. But as soon as the user clicks on the password-changing link, the attacker receives the genuine token the website sends the user by email in the attacker server. Now the attacker can change the token in the password-changing link, and he can change the user's password.

DDoS attack: Another attack carried on by an HTTP protocol vulnerability is a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS). When a user wants to visit a website, he must complete TCP three-way handshake. Next, the client sends an SYN packet to the server, indicating its desire to initiate a connection. The server then responds with an SYN-ACK packet, indicating its willingness to establish a connection. The final step involves the client sending an ACK packet, confirming that it has received the server's response and that the connection has been established. But in this attack, the attacker does not establish the TCP connection but sends only the SYN packet to the server. The SYN packet is tiny in size. To make it bigger, the attacker uses a packet amplifier before sending the packet to the server. We call this a Denial of service or (DoS) attack. Also, to make it more effective, the attacker uses a lot of zombie computers called a botnet. When many botnets send SYN requests to the server simultaneously, we call this Distributed denial of service or (DDoS) attack. A DDoS attack aims to disrupt the normal functioning of the target system or website by overwhelming its resources. This can result in legitimate users who cannot access the system or website.

(S)kills:

In this skill part, I will demonstrate the tool I will use to attack the HTTP protocol's vulnerability, such as HTTP host header attack.

HTTP host header attack has been the most common and manipulating attack since it was discovered. However, by pulling the data from the National vulnerability database(NVD), I found it overwhelming, still compromising, and never outdated. For example, in the table from NVD, we can see that among the 25101 vulnerabilities, and there are 39 vulnerabilities still exist.
